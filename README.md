Note that this needs codox â‰¥ 0.10.0.

[codox]: https://github.com/weavejester/codox
[rdash]: http://rdash.github.io/

## Usage

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/codox-theme-rdash.svg)](https://clojars.org/codox-theme-rdash)

Then set the following:

```clojure
:codox {:themes [:clojang]}
```

For syntax highlighting capabilities, you'll need to activate Markdown rendering
via:

```clojure
:codox {:metadata {:doc/format :markdown}
        :themes [:rdash]}
```
